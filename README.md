## Training&Inference code
 - To be released, still in the data disclosure process.
 - The training pipeline of Swiftnet is similar with the training pipeline of [STM](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Oh_Video_Object_Segmentation_Using_Space-Time_Memory_Networks_ICCV_2019_paper.html). You could refer to our reproduced [STM training code](https://github.com/haochenheheda/Training-Code-of-STM).
